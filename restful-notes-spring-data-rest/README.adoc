== Building the Sample

You will need Java 17 to build the sample.
It is built using Maven:

./mvnw verify
----

As part of the build, files named `build/docs/asciidoc/api-guide.html` and `build/docs/asciidoc/getting-started-guide.html` are created.
They are produced using Asciidoctor and include snippets generated by the sample's tests using Spring REST Docs.
